I understand you're asking about a disk defragmentation problem where files are moved as whole units to the leftmost available free space, starting with the highest file ID. This is a variation on the previous problem where individual blocks were moved.

To solve this problem, we would need to:

1. Parse the input to identify files and their positions
2. Sort the files by ID in descending order
3. For each file, find the leftmost contiguous free space that can fit the entire file
4. Move the file if such a space is found
5. Calculate the checksum after all moves are complete

Here's a high-level approach to implement this in Kotlin:

```kotlin:src/DayXX.kt
fun main() {
    val input = readInput("DayXX")
    val disk = input[0].toMutableList()
    
    val files = parseFiles(disk)
    val sortedFiles = files.sortedByDescending { it.id }
    
    for (file in sortedFiles) {
        val newPosition = findLeftmostFreeSpace(disk, file.size)
        if (newPosition != -1) {
            moveFile(disk, file, newPosition)
        }
    }
    
    val checksum = calculateChecksum(disk)
    println("Resulting filesystem checksum: $checksum")
}

data class File(val id: Int, val start: Int, val size: Int)

fun parseFiles(disk: List<Char>): List<File> {
    // Implementation to parse files from the disk
}

fun findLeftmostFreeSpace(disk: List<Char>, size: Int): Int {
    // Implementation to find the leftmost free space of required size
}

fun moveFile(disk: MutableList<Char>, file: File, newPosition: Int) {
    // Implementation to move the file to the new position
}

fun calculateChecksum(disk: List<Char>): Int {
    // Implementation to calculate the checksum
}
```

This solution follows the structure of previous solutions in the codebase, using a `main` function and helper functions to break down the problem. The exact implementation details would depend on the specific input format and requirements.

To integrate this into the existing codebase, you would create a new file (e.g., `src/DayXX.kt` where XX is the day number) and implement the solution there. You can use the utility functions from `Utils.kt` if needed, such as `readInput`.
