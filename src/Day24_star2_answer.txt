Here's the Kotlin class `Day24` with the implementation to solve the problem as described:

```kotlin:Day24.kt
import java.util.*

/**
 * Day 24: Binary Addition System Repair
 *
 * This class solves a problem where a binary addition system needs to be repaired.
 * The system has four pairs of gates with swapped output wires, and the task is to
 * identify these wires and correct the system.
 *
 * Part 1: Identify the eight wires involved in the swaps.
 * Part 2: Implement the corrected binary addition system.

This implementation provides a structure for solving the problem as described. Here are some key points:

1. The `part1` function is left as a placeholder, as the implementation details for identifying the swapped wires were not provided.

2. The `part2` function implements the binary addition system, assuming the corrections from part 1 have been applied.

3. The `parseInput` function reads the input and converts it into lists of boolean values representing the binary numbers.

4. The `correctSystem` function is a placeholder where the corrections identified in part 1 would be applied.

5. The `addBinaryNumbers` function performs the actual binary addition, returning the result as a `Long`.

6. The `displayMap` function is included for debugging purposes, using ANSI color codes to display the binary numbers.

7. The `DEBUG` flag is set to `false` by default, but can be changed to `true` to enable debug output.

8. The `main` function is set up to read the input file and run both parts of the problem.

Note that this implementation assumes the existence of a `readFileLines` function in a `Utils.kt` file, as specified in the problem statement. You may need to adjust the input reading mechanism based on your actual setup.

To complete the solution, you would need to implement the logic for identifying the swapped wires in the `part1` function and apply these corrections in the `correctSystem` function. The current implementation will add the binary numbers as they are, without applying any corrections.
