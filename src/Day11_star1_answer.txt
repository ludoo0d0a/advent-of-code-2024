To solve this problem, we need to implement the given rules for stone transformation and apply them 25 times to the initial arrangement of stones. Here's a Kotlin implementation that solves this problem:

```kotlin:src/Day11.kt
fun main() {
    val input = readInput("Day11")
    val initialStones = input.first().split(" ").map { it.toLong() }
    
    println(part1(initialStones))
}

fun part1(initialStones: List<Long>): Int {
    var stones = initialStones
    repeat(25) {
        stones = stones.flatMap { transformStone(it) }
    }
    return stones.size
}

fun transformStone(stone: Long): List<Long> {
    return when {
        stone == 0L -> listOf(1)
        stone.toString().length % 2 == 0 -> splitStone(stone)
        else -> listOf(stone * 2024)
    }
}

fun splitStone(stone: Long): List<Long> {
    val digits = stone.toString()
    val mid = digits.length / 2
    val left = digits.substring(0, mid).toLong()
    val right = digits.substring(mid).toLong()
    return listOf(left, right)
}

fun readInput(name: String) = File("src", "$name.txt").readLines()
```

This solution does the following:

1. We read the input from a file named "Day11.txt" in the src directory.
2. We parse the initial arrangement of stones into a list of Long values.
3. In the `part1` function, we apply the transformation rules 25 times.
4. The `transformStone` function implements the three rules for stone transformation:
   - If the stone is 0, it becomes 1.
   - If the stone has an even number of digits, it splits into two stones.
   - Otherwise, the stone is multiplied by 2024.
5. The `splitStone` function handles the splitting of stones with an even number of digits.
6. After 25 transformations, we return the number of stones.

To use this solution:

1. Create a file named `Day11.txt` in the `src` directory.
2. Put your input (the initial arrangement of stones) in this file as a single line of space-separated numbers.
3. Run the `main` function.

The output will be the number of stones after 25 blinks.

This solution efficiently handles the transformation rules and should work for large inputs as well. The use of `Long` instead of `Int` ensures that we can handle large numbers that might result from multiplying by 2024 multiple times.
