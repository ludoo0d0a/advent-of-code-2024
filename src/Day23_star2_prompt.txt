considering the following problem: 

There are still way too many results to go through them all. You'll have to find the LAN party another way and go there yourself. Since it doesn't seem like any employees are around, you figure they must all be at the LAN party. If that's true, the LAN party will be the largest set of computers that are all connected to each other. That is, for each computer at the LAN party, that computer will have a connection to every other computer at the LAN party. In the above example, the largest set of computers that are all connected to each other is made up of co, de, ka, and ta. Each computer in this set has a connection to every other computer in the set: ka-co
ta-co
de-co
ta-ka
de-ta
ka-de
 The LAN party posters say that the password to get into the LAN party is the name of every computer at the LAN party, sorted alphabetically, then joined together with commas. (The people running the LAN party are clearly a bunch of nerds.) In this example, the password would be co,de,ka,ta. What is the password to get into the LAN party?

then please write a Kotlin class named Day23, with a main function, to solve this problem. 
the main method should compute : 

The first part of the problem is solved, now consider the second part of the problem, 
Another method named 'part2', called from main() method, solves this second part of the problem.
Keep the implementation of 'part1' from current class 'Day23'.
Compute the result for the sample named 'Day23_star2_sample' and for the input, named 'Day23_input'.
Print the result of part2 to the console.
EXPECTED_SAMPLE is the expected value for the sample, listed in the problem.
Now it should be like this : 
'
@JvmStatic
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
//    val sample2 = readFileLines("Day23_star2_sample")
//    val result_sample2 = part2(sample2)
//    println("sample2 result=$result_sample2")
    
    val input = readFileLines("Day23_input")
//    val result_input = part1(input)
//    println("Result=$result_input")
    
    val result2_input = part2(input)
    println("Result2=$result_input")
}
' 
            

Use readFileLines() method from Utils.kt to read the content of the input file.
Do not add a method readFileLines().

Display map on each iteration, using ansi colored characters, and a boolean flag constant DEBUG (by default = false).
Optimize the algorithm to be efficient and fast so that solution can be found in a reasonable amount of time. 
Use indexes as soon as you can to avoid re-calculating the same value and lost time in long computation. 
Use map as List<CharArray>.
use Long instead of Int to avoid overflow.
Use println("") instead println().
Import java.util.* at the top of the class, if not there.
Add this prompt in comment at the top of the code.
Show the whole code for the kotlin class.
